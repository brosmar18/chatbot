# Chatbot Project

## Overview

This chatbot project is a desktop application built using Python, Tkinter, and spaCy. It showcases advanced features like Natural Language Understanding (NLU), sentiment analysis, and context-aware conversations.

## Features

### Core Features

1. **Time-based Greetings**: The chatbot greets the user based on the time of day.
2. **Simple Conversation Handling**: Handles basic conversations based on a predefined set of responses.
3. **Knowledge Query**: Answers general knowledge questions from a predefined knowledge base.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the user's input to generate responses.
5. **Advanced NLU**: Uses spaCy's NLP capabilities to recognize named entities in the user's queries.

### UI Features

1. **Chat Area**: A text area where the chat history is displayed.
2. **User Entry**: An entry box for the user to type in their messages.
3. **Send Button**: A button to send the message and receive a response from the bot.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend logic is written in Python.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the desktop application UI.
- **spaCy**: Used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
